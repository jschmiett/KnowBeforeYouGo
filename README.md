## Project Title:
Know Before uGo

## User Story:
AS AN international travel enthusiast I WANT a centralized location to research basic information that would be helpful to know before traveling to a city outside of the United States SO THAT it's easier for me to prepare to travel outside my country.

When I enter the name of a city I will be presented with information about traveling to that city, such as air quality index of that city, local language and currency, currency exchange rate, and options for purchasing airfare.

##Technologies Used:
Javascript, HTML, and CSS
